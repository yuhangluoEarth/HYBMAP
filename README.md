# HYBMAP, a global hybrid land-cover maps from 2000 to 2020 with a resolution of approximately 1 km
Include the code to produce HYBMAP and images from the manuscript
* A hybrid global annual 1 km IGBP land cover maps for the period 2000 - 2020 (HYBMAP). 
* HYBMAP integrated four widely-used land cover products (MODIS-IGBP, ESA-CCI, Globeland30, and GLC_FCS30) based on their accuracy against a collection of 114,620 reference samples.
* The annual records of the HYBMAP can be accessed freely at the Zenodo repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7095045). 
* In the Zenodo repository, HYBMAP provides a global land cover product (“** _LC.tif”) and corresponding cumulative affinity scores ( “** _Aff.tif”) from 2000 to 2020 at a resolution of 30” × 30” (1/120°, ~1 km2). The Legend file provides the corresponding Code and Description for IGBP classification.
